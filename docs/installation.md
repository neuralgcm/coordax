# Installation

You can install Coordax from source using pip:
```
pip install coordax
```

Coordax currently has a handful of required dependencies (chex, jax, numpy, treescope, xarray)
and one optional dependency ([jax-datetime](https://github.com/google/jax-datetime)).
We could potentially slim these required dependencies down -- open a GitHub issue if you're interested!
